To use the codes from this work, you need to copy the repository by running


 git clone https://github.com/Monsalves-Gonzalez-N/Paper_OGLE.git

Now, you must create a conda environment with the necessary packages. Inside the folder, there is a yml file that contains the packages used in this work. You can create the environment with the command


 conda env create -f environment.yml --name put_your_env_name
 
 
And that's it!
